# PridePack Versioning

The versioning shall consist of three elements:

- Major Version `M.u.f`
- Format Version `m.F.u`
- Fix Version `m.f.U`

With `Format` being the Minecraft versions' Resource/Texture Pack Format version, and the other ones following [`semver`](https://semver.org)

For example, in b1.7.3, the release is 1.0.0, because the `Resource Pack Format` didn't exist until 1.6. In the 1.6.1 version should be 1.1.0, as the `Resource Pack Format` version for 1.6.1 is `1`.
